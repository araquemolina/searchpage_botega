working with display grid, seems every time when working with grids grid-template-rows is also use aswell as 
grid-template-columns with values like :repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr)); and 1fr 1fr for columns

justify-items and align-items seems to be a common way to center things.
vh (viewHeight) is also used a lot

css: in css you can target text with brackets ex.
.this_class [type=text] {
    ....
}
